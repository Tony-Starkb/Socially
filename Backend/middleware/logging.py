"""
In this module, we define a middleware that will logging the request for each and 
everyincoming HTTP request and will log these as mentioned: method, path, status code, header. 
This logging will be used for debugging and tracing purposes throughout the 
application. The middleware will log the request details before processing the request 
and log the response details after processing the request. This will help in 
identifying the issues and debugging the application effectively.
