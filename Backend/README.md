# InstaCore

**A production-style Instagram backend clone built with FastAPI.**

InstaCore replicates the core backend systems behind a social media platform — authentication, posts, social graph (follows), likes, and role-based moderation — built with the same architectural patterns used in real production APIs.

Not a tutorial project. Every design decision — from composite primary keys to token rotation — was made to solve a specific real-world failure mode, not just to make the demo work.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Designing a relational database schema before writing any application code
- Authentication done properly: password hashing, JWT access/refresh tokens, token rotation with breach detection
- Two-layer input validation that blocks privilege escalation at the schema level
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for user / moderator / admin permission tiers
- Middleware for request tracing and structured logging
- Database constraints that make invalid states structurally impossible — not just logically unlikely
- Automated API testing with isolated, disposable test environments

---

## Core Features

### 🔐 Authentication

- Registration with bcrypt password hashing (cost factor 12)
- Login issues a short-lived **access token** (JWT) and a long-lived **refresh token**
- Refresh token stored in an **HttpOnly cookie** — inaccessible to JavaScript, mitigating XSS
- **Token rotation**: every refresh invalidates the previous refresh token and issues a new one
- **Breach detection**: reuse of a revoked refresh token triggers revocation of *all* tokens for that user, forcing full re-authentication

### 👤 Users & Social Graph

- Public user profile lookup by username
- Follow / unfollow system with full edge-case handling:
  - Self-follow attempts blocked (`400`)
  - Duplicate follow blocked (`409`)
  - Unfollowing a user you don't follow blocked (`409`)
- Followers / following list retrieval
- The `follows` table uses a **composite primary key** (`follower_id`, `following_id`) — duplicate follows are impossible at the database level, not just checked in application code

### 📝 Posts

- Full CRUD: create, read, update, delete
- Authentication required for feed access and post operations
- Media upload step with Cloudinary integration: `POST /api/v1/posts/upload-media` returns an `image_url` before creating the post
- Uses Cloudinary as the CDN/media storage backend so the app stores only secure image URLs, not raw files
- Commenting support: add comments to posts and delete comments cleanly
- Ownership enforcement — users can only edit or delete their own posts (`403` otherwise)
- Like / unlike system using a composite primary key (`post_id`, `user_id`) on the `post_likes` table — a user cannot like the same post twice, enforced by the schema itself
- Soft-delete pattern via `is_deleted` flag — preserves referential integrity instead of hard-deleting rows

### 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Three roles: `user`, `moderator`, `admin` — enforced through a single reusable dependency:

```python
Depends(require_role({"admin", "moderator"}))
```

- **Admin**: change any user's role, ban (delete) any user
- **Moderator + Admin**: delete any post, view any user's full profile (including private accounts)
- Adding a new protected route is one line — no repeated permission-checking logic scattered across files

### 📡 Middleware & Observability

- Every request gets a unique `X-Request-ID` — reused from upstream (CDN/gateway) if present, generated fresh otherwise
- Structured request logging: method, path, status code, duration (using `perf_counter()` for accurate millisecond timing)
- `request_id` included in every error response — enables tracing a specific failed request through logs instantly

### ⚠️ Structured Error Handling

Every error returns the same consistent format — no stack traces, no internal details leaked:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "message": "Post with id 3 not found.",
    "request_id": "a373af91-9aa6-46b2-ae64-4b858719294c"
  }
}
```

Custom exception classes (`PostNotFound`, `UserNotFound`, `NotAuthorized`) plus global handlers for validation errors (`422`) and unexpected crashes (`500`, logged internally, never exposed to the client).

### 🧪 Input Validation

Two layers, by design:

**Layer 1 — Pydantic schemas**
- `extra="forbid"` on every schema — a request body containing `role="admin"` during registration is rejected with `422`, not silently ignored
- Response models never include `password_hash` — structurally impossible to leak it
- Field constraints mirror Instagram's real limits (username max 30 chars, bio max 150, caption max 2200)

**Layer 2 — Custom validators**
- Password: minimum 8 characters, requires a letter, number, and special character
- Username: regex-enforced character set, cannot start/end with special characters

### ✅ Automated Tests

Tests spin up a real server on a random port with isolated, temporary data — no shared state between runs. Coverage includes:

- Login success/failure, HttpOnly cookie verification
- Privilege escalation attempts blocked at the schema level
- Full post lifecycle: create → update → delete → confirm `404`
- Like / unlike, including duplicate-action conflict (`409`)
- Validation errors never leak internal stack traces

## Database Schema

| Table | Purpose | Key Design Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | Account data | Role field for RBAC |
| `posts` | User posts | Soft-delete via `is_deleted` |
| `auth_tokens` | Refresh token tracking | Enables revocation & breach detection |
| `post_likes` | Like records | Composite PK `(post_id, user_id)` — duplicate likes impossible |
| `follows` | Social graph | Composite PK `(follower_id, following_id)` — duplicate follows impossible, self-referential FK |

## Design Notes

A few decisions worth calling out, since they reflect *why* the project is structured this way:

- **Composite primary keys over application-level checks** — for likes and follows, uniqueness is guaranteed by the database schema itself, not by an `if exists` check that could theoretically race under concurrent requests.
- **`extra="forbid"` on every Pydantic schema** — without this, a request body with an unexpected `role` field could silently succeed and grant elevated permissions. Forbidding extra fields closes that door at the validation layer, before it ever reaches business logic.
- **Refresh token rotation with breach detection** — a stolen refresh token is more dangerous than a stolen access token because it lasts 7 days instead of 30 minutes. Detecting reuse of an already-rotated token and wiping all sessions limits the blast radius of a leaked token.

## Status

Actively under development. Auth, posts, social graph, and RBAC are functional and tested. Comments and a feed endpoint are planned next.
